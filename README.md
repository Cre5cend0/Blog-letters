# letters
Letters is a blog for anyone who wants to express their thoughts without any fear of being judged, misused, or complained about.

> Or maybe you want the world to hear you without knowing who you are, but instead just listen, with no prejudice or stereotyping at heart.

>> And if you share it on social media, it might get lost in algorithms, or flooded with supporters and you develop "likes" addiction 
>> or get suppressed with haters and condescending comments, and you can't maintain anonymity and peace of mind.

>>> What you get here is not some artificial dopamine hit with likes or anxiety by watching other's success.
What you get is the pure joy of writing something that anyone in this world can read about.
Bless you for talking about it and learn from your experiences.
